JIeeeBanners
============

Simply adds a rotation for banners (heavily based on J! 2.5's mod_banner). Rotation should happen once every ten seconds. Rotation will appear only if multiple banners are indicated in the configuration. Every banner will be loaded by the browser, but only one will be visible. With JavaScript enabled, this banner will change. 

Installation: copy mod_jieeebanners into your modules folder (./modules, assuming your cwd is the root of your Joomla! website), discover the extensions, install com_jieeebanners, you're done.
